This branch keeps binary compatibility with v1.1 DD-001 ROM and corresponding utilities.
I disassembled some of them here to have some examples about API usage.

Type `make` to build binaries. Type `make regress` to check binaries from `build/` folder against files dumped from the original DD-001 boot disk.
