Maciej Witkowiak's note about software:
---------------------------------------

Go to src/ folder for updated and corrected firmware for both original and cloned TIB DD-001 Drive controller for C64.

More information in src/README.md

Steve Gray's note about hardware:
---------------------------------

This is a project to clone the TIB-001 Drive for the C64.
The TIB drive uses a standard Floppy Disk Controller (FDC)
along with custom Firmware and a standard 3.5" floppy mechanism.

Once cloned my goal is to adapt this to other Commodore systems.

Schematics are drawn with Kicad.
